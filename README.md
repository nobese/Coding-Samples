# Coding-Samples
This repository contains a few samples that demonstrate my previous coding experience. For your reference, the following is a short description of each file included:

**PIC_Control_C**: A script written in C that utilizes an MSP430G2553 microcontroller to implement a PIC control scheme on an external thermoelectric cooling unit. 

**PIC Controller Design Report**: A formal report accompanying PIC_Control_C that includes related pseudocode, flow charts, and troubleshooting procedures implemented in the project.

**Rabi_Oscillation_Python**: Utilizes QuTiP in Python to simulate and analyse Rabi Oscillations observed in a lab setting. Includes full theory breakdown and explanation of the Hamiltonians and Lindbladians used in the model.
