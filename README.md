# Coding-Samples
This repository contains a few samples that demonstrate my previous coding experience. For your reference, the following is a short description of each file included:

**PID_Control_C**: A script written in C that utilizes an MSP430G2553 microcontroller to implement a PID control scheme on an external thermoelectric cooling unit. 

**PID Controller Design Report**: A formal report accompanying PID_Control_C that includes related pseudocode, flow charts, and troubleshooting procedures implemented in the project.

**Rabi_Oscillation_Python**: Utilizes QuTiP in Python to simulate and analyse Rabi Oscillations observed in a lab setting. Includes full theory breakdown and explanation of the Hamiltonians and Lindbladians used in the model. 

**GaussLaw_Simulation**: A MATLAB simulation that numerically solves Gauss' law for a nodalized field.

**MetrologyLab_Arduino**: Lab report written for a class on Engineering Metrology that utilized an arduino mini to complete labs. Does not include arduino code as that was written collaboratively, but demonstrates familiarity with Arduinos.
